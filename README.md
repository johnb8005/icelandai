- **SQLite Database**: Persistent data storage with full CRUD operations

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (SQLite integration)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with bun:sqlite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with Bun server

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Initialize the SQLite database
   - Create tables and indexes
   - Load sample wine data

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

4. **Run production server**:
   ```bash
   bun start
   ```
